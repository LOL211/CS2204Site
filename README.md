# CS2204Site
This is the javascript edition
Main highlights

UI is decently flexible, can adjust to resonable sizes but has issues with exteremely tiny sizes
The very little html hardcoding, the entire movies, almost everything is just created based of json files and can handle any amount of data, something like 50 movies, 20 cinemas are all manageable, this site was built to the specification of the assignment and does not necessarily handle maps in the most efficent way. 
I learned a lot from my first try at javascript and the code can be significantly improved in the future but need more training for it.

note- features like jquery were not allowed
