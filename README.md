# CS2204Site

This is the css section of the website
It was made with very simple css combined with some more complicated featuers like flexboxes and media queries to make a decent page. Overall the desgin plan was to have it be a mix of minimalist, clean and simple style but also make sure it has the features and looks modern. 

It can definitely be improved since this was just a start into css, it doesn't use things like variables and no frameworks were alowed but these are defeintly some areas I'd want to explore with more front web dev projects
