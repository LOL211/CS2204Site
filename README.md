This site was developed for CS2204 Class project
It's seperated into 3 different branches
Master branch represents HTML structure
CW2 branch is HTML+CSS 
CW3 branch is HTML+CSS+JS added
Total time worked on the website is roughly 1 week at best

link to html only - https://cs2204cw1.netlify.app/
link to html+css - https://cs2204cw2.netlify.app/
link to html+css+js - https://cs2204cw3.netlify.app/
(to properly test out the js, I'd recommend downloading the cw3 branch and adding lots of cinemas, movies, shows, maps.)
