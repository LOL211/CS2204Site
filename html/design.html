    <h3>CW3: JavaScript</h3>
     <ol>
         <li>Overall use of JavaScript and explaination:
            <p>
                 Majority of the javascript used in the project was in external javascript files stored locally. The only use of javascript inside of html was in the body to call setup functions of thier own javascript files. All events were handled and set in javascript because majority of the objects were created dynamically. The only non javascript 'events' are the anchor/reference tags used to open different pages. All the events were handled in javascript, so it was choice to have them all be attached (other than setup on body load) in javascript too.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                 Use of InnerHTML and document.createElement():<br>I used innerHTML for more non-interactive or simple features like displaying forms, etc. I used docuement.creatElement for more complex pices like flexbox divs to generate them all properly and setup thier properties easily.Using innerHTML for them would make it too long and complex to debug, using createElement was long as well but cleaner and easier to understand.
            </p>
            <p> 
                 Use of let, var and const: Most of the variables were let for ease and vars in for loops did not properly work when creating listners and setting function parameters dynamically. const was used to store getCinemas and getMovies to make it easy to refer to instead of calling the function multiple times.
             </p> 
         </li>
         <li>Use of Event Handlers:
             In Javascript<ul>
                 <li>
                     Movies.js: An event handler was used for when the video ended, then next video method should play, and an event handler was used for when you click on a image, it scrolls up to where the video player is and plays the trailer.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     NowShowing.js: An event handler was used for the selectbox to see if it was changed, and if so, then update the movie values.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     ticket.js: Used event handlers for onlick for table elements to update the boxes and set the tickets. Another event listner is added to make the mouse curor not a pointer to make it clear to the user it's no longer clickable
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     print.js: No event handler was used for this page, since all the elements would be loaded on setup. The query string is processed into tickets and seperate show index then all the tickets are displayed.
                 </li>
             </ul>
         </li>
     </ol>

            </li>
            <li> 
                <p> The main colors were a mix of black, grey and white.<br>The main theme was nav bar on the left vertically, logo on top and the content in between. The footer was included into the nav bar as well. The content sections always had white background on the grey body for contrast</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Style Sheets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A default.css was used for all the common css between pages</li>
            <li> <p>Each page also had it's own css file for it's unique content</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Default.css contained all the CSS for the nav bar, basic theme like colors, common classes for headings and the logo animation</li>
                    <li>index.css contained the page specific css for the index page. It managed adjusting of the video, flex box divs for the upcoming and now showing movies. The css made the page resizeable and moveable</li>
                    <li>nowshowing.css contained the page specific css for the nowshowing page. The styling of the forms, the flexbox format similar to the index.css, hover effects and an animation for font increase on hover.</li>
                    <li>ticket.css contained the page specific css for the ticket booking page. The table to hover over, the button for confirming to go to print page, confirmationg of tickets buying and styling of it's forms</li>
                    <li> print.css contained the page specific css for print page. It managed the media query notably for print preview and stylized it's forms.</li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>
            
            <li> No embedded sheets were used and all of the css was in the files (excluding this page)</li>
            <li> <p>CSS3 Features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Animation: Default.css Line 1 for logo Animation </li>
                    <li> Animation: nowshowing.css Line 3 for increasing font on hover</li>
                    <li> Use of Flexbox styling: Line 53, parent, child and childof class were used to make a responsive page<br> When the page would be resized, each of the divs would flex around, and also the content inside them would flex to match it. Also used on nowshowing Line 13 for same reason.</li>
                    <li>Use of BoxShadow: Line 56, default.css, Line 12 and 77 index.css, Line 35 nowshowing.css, Line 5 and 51 of ticket.css.<br>The shadows were used to show partitons when backgrounds were same or give the effect of a div rising when the user hovered to make the website more interactive. </li>
                    <li>Media Query: Line 44 default.css: This was used to adjust the size of the nav bar when resizing window. The body's margin was set according to nav bar's width which changed with resizing. So by setting a margin at first, a query was used to change it to a percent according to screen size.</li>
                    <li>Media Query: Line 40 nowshowing.css: Media query was used to enable hover animations if the user's screen was wide enough. The hover animations would glitch with smaller screens so this was used.</li>
                    <li>Media Query: Line 24 print.css: This was used to remove all elements other than the tickets when using print preview.</li>
                </ul>

            Common Information:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Header: a simple nav inside a header tag was used for the links for navigation and the header also included the title and logo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Head: The head tag contained all the meta data and was kept seperate from the rest of the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    footer: a simple footer block with a p tag was used for all the information with a hr to split it from the rest of the page
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Home Page
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Video Player: This block was contained inside a section to have it's own formatting later on as main display of the page, to accomplish this a section tag was used. I also used a table to make the video player appear next to it's information for good organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now Showing and Upcoming: A table with it's own id was used for this, the table helped in formatting the entire section in rows with it's own headings and sort it out with upcoming and now showing movies. I used a similar format to other webpages I've seen.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now Showing page:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Selection box for choosing cinema: Since this was a single element it was enclosed into basic form element tag inside the body with it's options and given an id for formatting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    List of movies: It was enclosed inside a section and used a table for formatting and organized into rows and with forms enclosing selectable boxes for different timings.

                <li>
                    Cinema Map Locations: A section was used to enclose this and used articles with a class for each map location and heading for easy formatting and adding later. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Ticket Page: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Headings: The headings were done with forms because in the future they need to able to be changed and readonly so it can't be edited. A section was used to enclose it and with it's own id for later formating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Seating Plan: A table was used to organize to make a seating chart with rows and columuns and a table heading to mark the cinema screen location.
