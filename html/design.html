            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Style Sheets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A default.css was used for all the common css between pages</li>
            <li> <p>Each page also had it's own css file for it's unique content</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Default.css contained all the CSS for the nav bar, basic theme like colors, common classes for headings and the logo animation</li>
                    <li>index.css contained the page specific css for the index page. It managed adjusting of the video, flex box divs for the upcoming and now showing movies. The css made the page resizeable and moveable</li>
                    <li>nowshowing.css contained the page specific css for the nowshowing page. The styling of the forms, the flexbox format similar to the index.css, hover effects and an animation for font increase on hover.</li>
                    <li>ticket.css contained the page specific css for the ticket booking page. The table to hover over, the button for confirming to go to print page, confirmationg of tickets buying and styling of it's forms</li>
                    <li> print.css contained the page specific css for print page. It managed the media query notably for print preview and stylized it's forms.</li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>
            
            <li> No embedded sheets were used and all of the css was in the files (excluding this page)</li>
            <li> <p>CSS3 Features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Animation: Default.css Line 1 for logo Animation </li>
                    <li> Animation: nowshowing.css Line 3 for increasing font on hover</li>
                    <li> Use of Flexbox styling: Line 53, parent, child and childof class were used to make a responsive page<br> When the page would be resized, each of the divs would flex around, and also the content inside them would flex to match it. Also used on nowshowing Line 13 for same reason.</li>
                    <li>Use of BoxShadow: Line 56, default.css, Line 12 and 77 index.css, Line 35 nowshowing.css, Line 5 and 51 of ticket.css.<br>The shadows were used to show partitons when backgrounds were same or give the effect of a div rising when the user hovered to make the website more interactive. </li>
                    <li>Media Query: Line 44 default.css: This was used to adjust the size of the nav bar when resizing window. The body's margin was set according to nav bar's width which changed with resizing. So by setting a margin at first, a query was used to change it to a percent according to screen size.</li>
                    <li>Media Query: Line 40 nowshowing.css: Media query was used to enable hover animations if the user's screen was wide enough. The hover animations would glitch with smaller screens so this was used.</li>
                    <li>Media Query: Line 24 print.css: This was used to remove all elements other than the tickets when using print preview.</li>
                </ul>

        <li>
            Common Information:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Header: a simple nav inside a header tag was used for the links for navigation and the header also included the title and logo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Head: The head tag contained all the meta data and was kept seperate from the rest of the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    footer: a simple footer block with a p tag was used for all the information with a hr to split it from the rest of the page
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Home Page
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Video Player: This block was contained inside a section to have it's own formatting later on as main display of the page, to accomplish this a section tag was used. I also used a table to make the video player appear next to it's information for good organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now Showing and Upcoming: A table with it's own id was used for this, the table helped in formatting the entire section in rows with it's own headings and sort it out with upcoming and now showing movies. I used a similar format to other webpages I've seen.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now Showing page:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Selection box for choosing cinema: Since this was a single element it was enclosed into basic form element tag inside the body with it's options and given an id for formatting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    List of movies: It was enclosed inside a section and used a table for formatting and organized into rows and with forms enclosing selectable boxes for different timings. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cinema Map Locations: A section was used to enclose this and used articles with a class for each map location and heading for easy formatting and adding later. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Ticket Page: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Headings: The headings were done with forms because in the future they need to able to be changed and readonly so it can't be edited. A section was used to enclose it and with it's own id for later formating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Seating Plan: A table was used to organize to make a seating chart with rows and columuns and a table heading to mark the cinema screen location.
