            Common Information:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Header: a simple nav inside a header tag was used for the links for navigation and the header also included the title and logo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Head: The head tag contained all the meta data and was kept seperate from the rest of the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    footer: a simple footer block with a p tag was used for all the information with a hr to split it from the rest of the page
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Home Page
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Video Player: This block was contained inside a section to have it's own formatting later on as main display of the page, to accomplish this a section tag was used. I also used a table to make the video player appear next to it's information for good organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now Showing and Upcoming: A table with it's own id was used for this, the table helped in formatting the entire section in rows with it's own headings and sort it out with upcoming and now showing movies. I used a similar format to other webpages I've seen.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now Showing page:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Selection box for choosing cinema: Since this was a single element it was enclosed into basic form element tag inside the body with it's options and given an id for formatting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    List of movies: It was enclosed inside a section and used a table for formatting and organized into rows and with forms enclosing selectable boxes for different timings. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cinema Map Locations: A section was used to enclose this and used articles with a class for each map location and heading for easy formatting and adding later. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Ticket Page: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Headings: The headings were done with forms because in the future they need to able to be changed and readonly so it can't be edited. A section was used to enclose it and with it's own id for later formating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Seating Plan: A table was used to organize to make a seating chart with rows and columuns and a table heading to mark the cinema screen location.
